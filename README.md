# 2019 21-Day Coding Challenge by [Lighthouse Labs](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/)

### About

A yearly affair of a coding challenge, of which I also took part last year (2018) along with a team of all-rounder women developers.

I came to know of this by email from subscribing to updates from [Women in Web Dev](https://womeninwebdev.com) that was founded by [Jenny Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpychan/).

She wrote an article about [How An All-Women Team Won a 21-Day Coding Challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-all-women-team-won-21-day-coding-challenge-jenny-chan/) on LinkedIn.

The solutions for last year's challenge could be found on my github account [here](https://github.com/Paddlepop25/LIghthouse-Labs-21-day-JS-Coding-Challenge).

### Excerpt of 2019's Coding Challenge

Welcome to Codeville, and the 21-Day Coding Challenge! Technology has reached Codeville, and as the mayor of this small hamlet, you have the task of finding ways to use technology to improve your town. Over the next 21 days, you’ll use technology to streamline your re-election campaign, implement smart city technology to bring Codeville into the future, and plan a town celebration for the community. Each step along the way, you’ll use code to help you.

Are you ready? Let’s go!
